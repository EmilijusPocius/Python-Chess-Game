# Description: 
This is a simple hot seat Python chess game for two players on the same computer. The game displays all available moves, handles en passant, castling, pawn upgrades, checks, and checkmates, and includes a user interface (UI). Additionally, the game features a time.txt file allowing players to adjust their time limits. The first line represents the white player's time, and the second line represents the black player's time. To start the game, simply run the chess.py file. After closing the game, a game_info.txt file is generated, providing details on the duration of the game, the number of moves made by each player, and the outcome.
